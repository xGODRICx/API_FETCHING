/ There are 4 types of operations you can do with APIs
// C - Create Operations
// R - Reading Operations
    // We call reading operations "GET requests"
// U - Updating Operations
// D - Deleting Operations
// Guide on how to fetch data from api and render it on DOM
    // Step1: Store Owner (client) needs to make request of our middleman (API) to get data that we need for our store (our website)

            console.log(actualPokemonData)
